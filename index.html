    <h1>Welcome to My Research Website</h1>
    <p>I am Brhanu, a PhD student at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln.</p>
    
    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <p>
        I am specializing in the interplay between codon usage and protein expression in flaviviruses such as Zika, Dengue, and West Nile virus. My research integrates bioinformatics tools to analyze codon usage patterns, predict protein expression levels, and explore evolutionary adaptations across vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. By combining computational approaches with experimental techniques, I aim to uncover how codon usage bias influences viral protein folding, stability, and fitness, contributing to the development of effective vaccines and antiviral strategies.

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Prior to my PhD, I obtained my M.S. in Biomedical Science and Engineering from Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Korea. My thesis focused on revealing intricate 3D behavioral patterns in diabetic neuropathy mice using unsupervised machine learning algorithms, such as autoregressive models and hidden Markov models. I also hold a B.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Jimma University, Ethiopia.
